Proposed Solution
Configuration Template:

Create a single template configuration file (e.g., config-template.yaml or config-template.json) that holds the common configuration structure with placeholders for environment-specific values.
This template will define all necessary parameters, such as database credentials, log levels, and environment names, but leave key values to be dynamically replaced.
Environment-Specific .env Files:

For each environment (e.g., prod, dev, uat), create an individual .env file (e.g., .env.prod, .env.dev, .env.uat) containing the values specific to that environment.
Example:
.env.prod: Contains production-specific values (e.g., database host, API keys).
.env.dev: Contains development-specific values for testing.
.env.uat: Contains values for user acceptance testing.
Dynamic Value Replacement:

A script or automation tool (e.g., Bash, Ansible, or Terraform) will be used to dynamically replace the placeholders in the template with values from the corresponding .env file.
For instance, using a simple envsubst command in Bash or variable substitution in tools like Ansible can generate the full configuration for each environment.
Deployment:

During deployment, the appropriate environment-specific .env file is loaded, and the configuration template is populated with the correct values, ensuring consistency and avoiding manual errors.
The final configuration file (e.g., config-prod.yaml) is then used by the application in the target environment.



Benefits of This Approach
Reduction in Configuration Files:

Consolidate over 20 configuration files into just two files: one template file and a small number of .env files.
Simplifies the overall configuration management and reduces the risk of inconsistencies.
Less Error-Prone:

Using a template file with environment-specific variables ensures that the same structure is used across all environments.
Eliminates manual errors due to misconfiguration or missing parameters in individual files.
Simplified Maintenance:

With only the .env files needing updates for different environments, managing configuration changes becomes much easier and quicker.
The template file can be updated as needed, and changes are automatically reflected across all environments when the .env files are updated.
Scalability:

Adding new environments (e.g., a new testing or staging environment) requires only a new .env file without changing the underlying configuration structure.
